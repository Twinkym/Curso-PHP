# Curso-PHP
# I created two `HTML` and `PHP` files that collect data from a form and display it in table and sorted.
# the format of the table and the visual design associated with a main website and a secondary website where
# the collected data will be displayed is about to be completed.
# In the php code I've used a for loop to go through the table and show after each cycle the nest line
# of table.
